## My process

### Built with

-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned that writing CSS with Styled Components takes really long time when I could write it faster in sass or pure css :-)

### Continued development

Looking for time to add a swipe functionnality to change tabs components.
